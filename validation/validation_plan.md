# OCT Image Extraction Application - Validation Report

## Overview
This document outlines the validation process and results for the OCT Image Extraction application, which is designed to extract and process images from Zeiss Cirrus OCT RAW files and Heidelberg OCT e2e files.

## Validation Framework
A comprehensive validation framework has been developed to test all aspects of the application:

1. **File Loading Validation**
   - File format detection
   - File loading
   - Metadata extraction
   - Preview generation
   - Frame extraction

2. **Image Processing Validation**
   - Frame image extraction
   - Image rotation (90°, 180°, 270°)
   - Image cropping with custom parameters
   - Combined processing (rotation + cropping)

3. **Export Validation**
   - PNG export
   - JPEG export
   - Processed image export

## Validation Process
The validation script (`validate_oct_extraction.py`) is designed to:
- Accept test files in both Zeiss (.img) and Heidelberg (.e2e) formats
- Run comprehensive tests on each file
- Generate detailed validation reports
- Export processed images for visual inspection

## Validation Requirements
To complete validation, the following is required:
- Sample OCT files in both Zeiss Cirrus (.img) and Heidelberg (.e2e) formats
- Sufficient disk space for exported test images
- Python environment with required dependencies

## Next Steps
Once sample files are provided, the validation process will:
1. Execute the validation script against all test files
2. Generate a detailed validation report
3. Identify and address any issues found
4. Confirm extraction and processing accuracy

## Packaging Plan
After successful validation, the application will be packaged for Windows using PyInstaller:
1. Create a standalone executable with all dependencies
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Ensure proper handling of file associations
4. Test the packaged application on Windows

## Documentation Plan
The final documentation package will include:
1. User manual with installation instructions
2. Feature documentation with screenshots
3. Troubleshooting guide
4. Technical implementation details
5. Sample workflows for common use cases
